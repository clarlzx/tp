## **Introduction**

ParentPal is a desktop application designed for parents to manage their children-related contacts and appointments. 
It is named ParentPal because it aims to be a 'pal' to the busy parents who need help managing their kids' schedules and important contacts.
ParentPal is built for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), the Graphical User Interface (GUI) is primarily meant
for displaying key information. 

ParentPal is largely built with Java. GUI related functionality is powered by JavaFX and CSS.

## **Design**
The following section provides details of the architecture and a few selected functionalities of the application.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/AppointmentWithUIClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/AppointmentWithLogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ParentPalParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a contact).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/AppointmentWithModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* stores the appointment book data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Contact>` and `Observable<Appointment>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Contact` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Contact` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)
</div>

![More detailed structure of Model Component](images/AppointmentAndContact.png)
* Some attributes have their own class, like `Name`, `DateTime`, and they contain methods to check for the validity of the value given by the user.
* `Name` and `Address` classes are referenced by both `Contact` and `Appointment` class and are hence not within the `Contact` or `Appointment` package.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/AppointmentWithStorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.
* can save the appointment book date in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
### Tagging features
#### Current Implementation 
The current tagging system uses objects of the `Tag` class and its children `ChildTag`. Each `Contact` in the
`AddressBook` maintains its own set of tags as a `HashSet<Tag>`. 

The `tag` command allows for the appending of tags to an existing
`Contact` without having to replace existing tags as offered by `edit` and is facilitated by 
the `TagCommand` and `TagCommandParser` classes.

![Tag Class Diagram](images/TagCommandClassDiagram.png)

As part of the `Model` component, other components interact with tags through the `Model.java` API.
As `Contact` objects are designed to be immutable, commands that involve manipulating Persons such as `edit` and `tag`
involve creating a new `Contact` and replacing the original `Contact` through `Model#setPerson()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the `tag` command and how the application behaves through its execution.

Step 1. The user executes `tag 1 tc/Adam t/formteacher` to add tags to a previous contact they have added.

Step 2. The `LogicManager` calls on the `AddressBookParser` to parse the user input
, which creates a new `TagCommandParser` object and calls its `parse` method.

Step 3. `TagCommandParser` will tokenize the given arguments using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()`. 
The `index` of `1` and option fields are parsed out. Since no option is used in this scenario,
the `isReplace` variable is set to `false`.

Step 4. `ParserUtil#parseTags` and `ParserUtil#parseChildTags` methods are used to generate `tagSet`, a `Set<Tag>`
containing `ChildTag:Adam` and `Tag:formteacher`.

Step 5. A new `TagCommand` is created using `index`, `tagSet`, and `isReplace` and returned to `AddressBookParser`
and subsequently `LogicManager`.

Step 6. `LogicManager` then calls the `execute` method of the newly created `TagCommand`.

Step 7. Similar to `EditCommand`, `TagCommand` will generate a new `Contact` object 
though the `createTaggedPerson` method which will have its tags appended with the new `Set<Tag>` defined by the command.

Step 8. The `Model#setPerson()` method is used to update the model with the newly tagged `Contact` and a `CommandResult`
representing success is returned to the `LogicManager`.

Shown below is the sequence diagram that visualises the above operations of a `tag` command.

![Tag Sequence Diagram](images/TagSequenceDiagram.png)

When displaying the tags in the UI as a `PersonCard`, a customised `TagComparator` that implements
`Comparator<Tag>` is used to sort the tags such that `ChildTag` will be placed first before regular
`Tag`. During the generation of the `Label` for the each `Tag` a different background color is then set
for `ChildTag`.


#### Design considerations

The decision to implement `ChildTag` as its own class rather than a boolean in the `Tag` class was to allow for the 
future extensibility of the program in being able to create more types of Tags in the future. 

This also allows for `ChildTag` to store its own seperate information from regular `Tag` if needed 
such as other details of the child itself. Extending `ChildTag` from the original `Tag` class allows for them to be 
stored within the same data structure allowing for easier manipulation by other commands that may deal with tags such
as `find`.

### Help feature

#### Implementation

The help mechanism is facilitated by `HelpCommandParser` and `HelpCommand`. `HelpCommandParser` implements `Parser#parse(args)` from the `Parser` interface. The `args` passed to the method specify the command to display information for. If `args` specifies more than one command, the last command will be taken. Otherwise, `HepCommandParser` returns a new `HelpCommand`.

If no commands were specified in `args`, the `HelpCommand` constructor without any parameters will be called. If a single command was specified, the command will be passed as an argument to the `HelpCommand(specifiedCommand)` constructor.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If multiple commands are specified, last command is taken.
</div>

To execute a `HelpCommand`, `HelpCommand#execute()` is called. The method reads and parses information in the user guide (found at resources/UserGuideCopy.md) into a `helpMessage` differently depending on whether a command was specified. `helpMessage` can contain the following:

* Command was not specified: A list of all available ParentPal commands that was parsed from the command summary table in the user guide.
* Command was specified: Information on the specified command taken from the user guide. If the specified command is not found in the user guide, an exception is thrown.

Given below are 2 example usage scenarios and how the help mechanism behaves in each scenario.

Scenario 1: User enters `help` without specifying commands.

Step 1. `LogicManager#execute(userInput)` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(userInput)`, which then parses the input into the command word and arguments, which is an empty string in this case. The empty string is passed to `HelpCommandParser#parse()`.

Step 2. A new `HelpCommand()` is returned.

Step 3. `LogicManager#execute()` calls `HelpCommand#execute()`, which then calls `HelpCommand#executeNonSpecific()`.

Step 4. The command summary table in the user guide is parsed so that each row is displayed as "commandName: description" in the `helpMessage` with the help of `HelpCommand#commandSummaryParser()`.

Step 5. The `helpMessage` is returned via a `CommandResult`. A default `helpTitle` is also returned via the `CommandResult`.

Step 6. `LogicManager#execute(userInput)` returns the `CommandResult` to `MainWindow#executeCommand`, which sets the help window header to `helpTitle` and the content to `helpMessage` via `HelpWindow#setHelpText()`.

Step 7. The help window is displayed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the 'help' operation works in this scenario:

![HelpSequenceDiagram1](images/HelpSequenceDiagram1.png)

Scenario 2: User enters `help find`.

Step 1. `LogicManager#execute(userInput)` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(userInput)`, which then parses the input into the command word and arguments, `find`. `find` is passed to `HelpCommandParser#parse(find)`.

Step 2. A new `HelpCommand(find)` is returned.

Step 3. `LogicManager#execute()` calls `HelpCommand#execute()`, which then calls `HelpCommand#executeSpecific()`.

Step 4. The user guide is searched for the section containing information on `find`.

Step 5. The information under the `find` section is parsed and appended to `helpMessage`.

Step 6. The `find` section heading is parsed and assigned to `helpTitle`. 

Step 7. The `helpMessage` and `helpTitle` are returned via a `CommandResult`.

Step 8. `LogicManager#execute(userInput)` returns the `CommandResult` to `MainWindow#executeCommand()`, which sets the help window header to `helpTitle` and the content to `helpMessage`.

Step 9. The help window is displayed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the 'help' operation works in this scenario:

![HelpSequenceDiagram2](images/HelpSequenceDiagram2.png)

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the help command:

![HelpActivityDiagram](images/HelpActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

##### Aspect: Where the information displayed in the help window is retrieved from

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Retrieve from user guide document stored in resource folder and packed into `JAR` file. 
  * Pros: Easy to update when features change, command classes will not be cluttered with a long `helpMessage` string.
  * Cons: Have to remember to copy the latest version of the user guide from the docs folder into the resources folder, scanning user guide for information each time help is called can be time consuming, have to parse markdown into plain text.

* **Alternative 2:** Retrieve from `helpMessage` string stored in each `Command` class. 
  * Pros: Easy to implement, easy to retrieve `helpMessage`, minimal processing needed.
  * Cons: To update the `helpMessage` of a command, we must search for its class and edit the `helpMessage` string manually. This essentially means we have do 2 updates every time a change is made to a command: one to the user guide and one to the command's class. 

* **Alternative 3:** Retrieve from user guide webpage.
  * Pros: Minimal updating needed when features change since only the user guide in the docs folder needs to be updated.
  * Cons: Does not work when ParentPal is used offline, implementation might be complicated, scanning user guide for information each time help is called can be time-consuming.
  
Alternative 1 was eventually chosen as we were planning to make major changes to ParentPal over several iterations. Since we are already expected to update the user guide with each iteration, it is more efficient to simply copy the latest user guide document into the resources folder after updates are made rather than to edit each `helpMessage`. Furthermore, as long as the format of the user guide remains constant, parsing the markdown text into plain text is manageable and does not take too much time. This alternative will also work when ParentPal is used offline, making the application easy to use on the go. Lastly, alternative 1 keeps the actual code and documentation separate, making it a more logical and organised implementation. As such, that is the alternative that was chosen. 

### Sort feature

#### Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by `SortCommand` and `SortCommandParser`.

`SortCommandParser` implements the following operation:
* `SortCommandParser#parse(String order)`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the arguments using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize`
  and checks for `option`.

`SortCommand` extends `Command`, and implements the following operation:
* `SortCommand#execute(Model model)`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes the sort command by sorting the `lastShownList`
  and updating the `model` accordingly.

Sorting by name is done using the `NameComparator`,by comparing `Contact` objects, which implement `Comparable<Contact>`.

Sorting by date is done using the `DateComparator`, which compares the `TimeAdded` attribute of the `Contact` objects.

The comparator is saved in `AddressBookSettings` so that the list stays sorted in the chosen order.

Given below are some example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Scenario 1: The user executes `sort o/name` after executing `list`.

Note: The `Contact` objects have been timestamped with the `TimeAdded` attribute.
By default, they will be displayed on in the order in which they were added.

Step 1. `LogicManager#execute(userInput)` calls `ParentPalParser#parseCommand(userInput)`,
which then parses the input into the command word and arguments, `o/name`.
`o/name` is passed to `SortCommandParser#parse(o/name)`.

Step 2. `SortCommandParser` will tokenize the given arguments using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()`.
The option field `name` is parsed out. A new `SortCommand("name")` is returned.

Step 3. `LogicManager#execute()` calls `SortCommand#execute()`.
The `model` is sorted accordingly using the `sortContactList` method,
which will use the `NameComparator` on `setAddressBookComparator`.

Step 4. The success message is returned to `LogicManager` via a `CommandResult`.
The displayed list would be sorted in alphabetical order.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:
![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

Scenario 2: The user executes `sort o/date` after executing `find john`, followed by `list`.

Step 1. `LogicManager#execute(userInput)` calls `ParentPalParser#parseCommand(userInput)`,
which then parses the input into the command word and arguments, `o/date`.
`o/date` is passed to `SortCommandParser#parse(o/date)`.

Step 2. `SortCommandParser` will tokenize the given arguments using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()`.
The option field `date` is parsed out. A new `SortCommand("date")` is returned.

Step 3. `LogicManager#execute()` calls `SortCommand#execute()`.
The `model` is sorted accordingly using the `sortContactList` method, 
which will use the `DateComparator` on `setAddressBookComparator`.

Step 4. The success message is returned to `LogicManager` via a `CommandResult`.
The displayed found list would be sorted in chronological order.

Step 5. When the user executes `list`, the displayed list will still be in chronological order as the `DateComparator` 
is stored in `AddressBookSettings`.

### Favourite feature

#### Implementation

The favourite mechanism is facilitated by `FavouriteCommand` and `FavouriteCommandParser`.

`FavouriteCommandParser` implements the following operation:
* `FavouriteCommandParser#parse(String args)`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the arguments using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize`
  and checks for `option`.
* If there are no options specified in `args`, it means the user is simply favouriting a contact, so `isFav` is set to true.
* If the `remove` option specified in `args`, it means the user is unfavouriting a contact, so `isFav` is set to false.

`FavouriteCommand` extends `Command`, and implements the following operation:
* `FavouriteCommand#execute(Model model)`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes the favourite command by creating an edited contact and 
  setting the `favourite` attribute using `EditCommand.EditContactDescriptor` based on `isFav`. 
  The `model` is then updated accordingly.

Given below are some example usage scenario and how the favourite mechanism behaves at each step.

Scenario 1: User enters `fav 3` after entering the `list` command.

Step 1. `LogicManager#execute(userInput)` calls `ParentPalParser#parseCommand(userInput)`, 
   which then parses the input into the command word and arguments, `3`. 
   `3` is passed to `FavouriteCommandParser#parse(3)`.

Step 2. `FavouriteCommandParser` will tokenize the given arguments using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()`.
   The `index` of `3` and option fields are parsed out. Since no option is used in this scenario,
   the `isFav` variable is set to `true`. A new `FavouriteCommand(3, true)` is returned.

Step 3. `LogicManager#execute()` calls `FavouriteCommand#execute()`.
   This creates an `EditContactDescriptor`, which is used to set the `favourite` attribute of the contact to `true`.
   A new favourited `Contact` is created. The `model` is updated accordingly.

Step 4. The success message and favourited `Contact` are returned to `LogicManager` via a `CommandResult`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the favourite operation works:
![FavouriteSequenceDiagram](images/FavouriteSequenceDiagram.png)

Scenario 2: User enters `fav 3 o/remove` after entering the `list` command.

Step 1. `LogicManager#execute(userInput)` calls `ParentPalParser#parseCommand(userInput)`,
which then parses the input into the command word and arguments, `4 o/remove`.
`4` is passed to `FavouriteCommandParser#parse(4 o/remove)`.

Step 2. `FavouriteCommandParser` will tokenize the given arguments using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()`.
The `index` of `4` and option field `remove` are parsed out. Since the `remove` option is used in this scenario,
the `isFav` variable is set to `false`. A new `FavouriteCommand(4, false)` is returned.

Step 3. `LogicManager#execute()` calls `FavouriteCommand#execute()`.
This creates an `EditContactDescriptor`, which is used to set the `favourite` attribute of the contact to `false`.
A new unfavourited `Contact` is created. The `model` is updated accordingly.

Step 4. The success message and unfavourited `Contact` are returned to `LogicManager` via a `CommandResult`.

The following activity diagram shows how the favourite operation works:
![FavouriteActivityDiagram](images/FavouriteActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

##### Aspect: How to implement the favourite feature

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Favouriting contacts is done using its own `FavouriteCommand`.
    * Pros: Most intuitive from a user's point of view. 
      In a clickable GUI, users would typically click on a star button to star the contacts.
      For a CLI, having a favourite command would be the most similar to that.
    * Cons: This involves editing the contact, which means it should use some implementation of the `EditCommand`.

* **Alternative 2:** Favouriting contacts is done as a subset of `EditCommand`.
    * Pros: Makes sense because we are essentially editing a field of the contact.
    * Cons: Does not look intuitive from the perspective of a user. 
      In a clickable GUI, users would not go to the edit contacts page just to favourite a contact.
      The editing is usually only for fields directly related to the details of the contact, 
      such as their name, phone or email.

* **Alternative 2:** Favouriting contacts is done as a subset of `TagCommand`.
    * Pros: Makes sense if we add favourite as a tag.
    * Cons: This could add clutter to the interface as there are already a lot of tags, and there are also child tags.

Alternative 1 was eventually chosen as being user-centric is a key aspect of software engineering.
Making the app intuitive to users is important, and in this case, it does not sacrifice too much in terms of implementation.
As such, that is the alternative that was chosen.

##### Aspect: How to save the favourite

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a `Favourite` class, each contact has a `favourite` attribute 
  and favourited contacts have a star icon next to their name.
    * Pros: Standardised with other fields that the contacts have.
    * Cons: More troublesome to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Favourite is saved and shown as a special tag.
    * Pros: Standardised style as the child tag, can be implemented the same way.
    * Cons: Might add unnecessary clutter when we have the word "favourite", as it could be easily represented by an icon.
    This is in contrast to tags which are best represented as text.

* **Alternative 3:** Favourite is saved as a boolean value under each contact,
  and favourited contacts have a star icon next to their name.
    * Pros: Simple to implement.
    * Cons: Not standardised with other contact fields, 
      might not be as readable to have a random boolean variable appear.

Alternative 1 was eventually chosen as it was the most standardised way 
and minimises the amount of clutter displayed to the user.
As such, that is the alternative that was chosen.

### Add feature

#### Implementation

The add mechanism is facilitated by `AddCommand` and `AddCommandParser`.

`AddCommandParser` implements the following operation:
* `AddCommandParser#parse(String order)`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the arguments using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize`
  and checks for if the various `args` are specified, only the `n/` arg is 
  compulsory to be specified.

`AddCommand` extends `Command`, and implements the following operation:
* `AddCommand#execute(Model model)`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes the add command by 
  adding the contact with the given `args`, if one of more args are not 
  specified a 'NIL' is automatically used as a placeholder.
  
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user enters `add n/David `. 

Step 2. LogicManager#execute(userInput) calls ParentPalParser#parseCommand(userInput), which then parses 
the input into the command word and arguments, ` n/David` . `n/David` is then passed to 
`AddCommandParser#parse(" n/David")`

Step 3. `AddCommandParser` will tokenize the given arguments using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` into the 
various fields for the `Contact`. A new `Contact` is created with these fields. Since only the `n/` arg is 
specified for this example, the string 'NIL' will be used for the remaining args.

Step 5. A new `AddCommand` is created using the new `Contact` and returned to `AddressBookParser`
and subsequently `LogicManager`.

Step 6. `LogicManager#execute()` calls `AddCommand#execute()`.

Step 7. The `Model#addContact()` method is used to add the new `Contact` into the model. The success message 
is returned to `LogicManager` via a `CommandResult`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:
![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations
##### Aspect: How to allow incomplete contacts to be added
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Setting a placeholder string when fields not specified
    * Pros: Lesser code refactoring, more uniform data in model so lesser need to check if a field is null.
    * Cons: Might affect future extensions if logic is applied on the placeholder.
    
* **Alternative 1:** Setting a placeholder class. 
    * Pros: Slightly more extendable 
    * Cons: More code refactoring leading to more bugs
    
Alternative 1 was eventually chosen due to ease of refactoring and low chance of future extensions being affected 
by the placeholder since it is a String and only one single use case of placeholders being use throughout the entire
project hence it would be unnecessary abstraction.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th contact in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new contact. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the contact was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the contact being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `ParentPal` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)
For our product, we have two different entities `Contact` and `Appointment`. Across the two entities,
some implementations are rather similar.
Therefore, for those implementations, we will use `ENTITY` to generalise the different entities and then provide use
cases for the general entity. If any of the features have a different implementation, we will provide the alternative use case below.


**UC1: Edit a `ENTITY`**

**MSS**

1.  User requests for a list of `ENTITY`
2.  ParentPal shows a list of `ENTITY`
3.  User requests to edit a specific `ENTITY` details in the list
4.  ParentPal edits the `ENTITY` details accordingly

    Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The list is empty.

  Use case ends.

* 3a. The given index is invalid.

    * 3a1. ParentPal shows an error message.

      Use case resumes at step 2.
    
    
**UC2: Delete a `ENTITY`**

**MSS**

1.  User requests for a list of `ENTITY`
2.  ParentPal shows a list of `ENTITY`
3.  User requests to delete a specific `ENTITY` in the list
4.  ParentPal deletes the `ENTITY`

    Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The list is empty.

  Use case ends.

* 3a. The given index is invalid.

    * 3a1. ParentPal shows an error message.

      Use case resumes at step 2.

**UC3: Add a tag to a contact**

**MSS**

1.  User requests to list contacts
2.  ParentPal shows a list of contacts
3.  User requests to tag a specific contact in the list with a specific tag name
4.  ParentPal adds the tag to the contact

    Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The list is empty.

  Use case ends.

* 3a. The given index is invalid.

    * 3a1. ParentPal shows an error message.

      Use case resumes at step 2.
    
* 3b. The given tag name already exists for that contact.

  Use case ends.

**UC4: Find an Existing `ENTITY` from the respective list**

**MSS**

1. User requests to find a `ENTITY`.
2. ParentPal shows the `ENTITY` details that match the attributes that the user has keyed in.  
   Use case ends

**Extensions**

* 1a. User enters an invalid input.
    * 1a1. ParentPal shows an error message.  
      Use case ends.
