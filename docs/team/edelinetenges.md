## Project: ParentPal

ParentPal is a desktop app for managing your childrenâ€™s contacts and their related appointments. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. 
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort contacts.
  * What it does: allows the user to sort the contact list in alphabetical or chronological order.
  * Justification: This feature helps users keep their contact list organised in whichever way they want, 
    and is a foundational function that users expect to have when they store a lot of information.
  * Highlights: 

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to favourite contacts and list favourited contacts.
  * What it does: allows the user to favourite or unfavourite contacts in the contact list.
  * Justification: This feature makes the process of finding frequently contacted people much easier.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affected many other commands, as favourite was a new attribute under a contact.
    In addition, the list command can now accept arguments in terms of options of what to list.
    It required analysis of design alternatives as there were multiple ways to implement it.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete appointments.
  * What it does: allows the user to delete appointments by index.
  * Justification: This feature is a core functionality.

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.2` - `v1.4` (4 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Prevent deleting of contacts that are involved in appointments (Pull requests [\#149](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/149))
