## Project: AddressBook Level 3

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=mechastriker3)
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add incomplete contacts.
  * What it does: allows the user to add contacts without specifying all the fields 
  * Justification: This feature improves the product as it allowed users to add contacts that 
    they might not have all the information for.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. 
    It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Pull requests: [#62](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/62)

* **New Feature**: Added ability to find contacts by specific fields.
  * What it does: allows the user to find contacts by specifying a specific field to search in by 
    adding `o/OPTION` to the command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user might know exactly what 
    they wish to find. By allowing them to search in the specified field, they can find contacts faster.
  * Highlights: The parser need to be edited to handle all the different options.This increased the number of branches in the code
    significantly, hence the implementation was challenging. The number of exceptions to be handled also increased, adding to the complexity.
    In addition, OOP was used as I extended the search predicates from a common parent class to prevent code duplication.
  * Pull requests: [#131](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/131), [#171](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/173)

* **New Feature**: Added ability to find contacts by any field.
  * What it does: allows the user to find contacts by searching through all the fields of the contact.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to quickly search through all the fields of the contact if they do not know which exact 
    field they want to search for. This will return more results rather than just searching by name.
  * Highlights: The implementation of varies predicates into a single predicate was challenging and required use of functional programming paradigms.
  * Pull requests:

* **New Feature**: Added ability to find appointments by specific fields.
  * What it does: allows the user to find appointments by specifying a specific field to search in by
    adding `o/OPTION` to the command.
  * Justification: **Similar to `find` command above**
  * Pull requests: [#141](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/141), [#176](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/176),

* **New Feature**: Added ability to find appointments by any field.
  * What it does: allows the user to find appointments by searching through all the fields of the appointment.
  * Justification **Similar to `find` command above**
  * Pull requests: [#147](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/147)

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Extend usage of `help` command from teammate [Nicole](https://github.com/nicoleang09).
  * What it does: Instead of just copying the link to the user's clipboard, allowed button to open the link in the user's default browser.
  * Justification: It is troublesome to click on `copy URL`, then paste the link into a browser.
  * Highlights: Had to make use of external libraries. Hence, the implementation was hard as it required understanding documentations and implementing them.
  * Pull requests: [#151](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/151) 
  
* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `findAppt` and `find` [\#272](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/272)
    * Edited documentation for feature `add` for **adding incomplete contacts** [\#103](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/103)
    * Edited documentation for feature `delete` for **deleting multiple contacts** [\#310](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/310)
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `add` feature [\#301](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/301)
    * Added use cases for `delete`, `find` in Appendix:Requirements [\#291](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/291)
    * Added test cases for **delete multiple** and `findAppt` and `find` features.
* **Community**:
  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [#17](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/17#issuecomment-767455612), [21](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/21), [#281](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/281#issuecomment-811904159), [#95](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/forum/issues/95#issuecomment-775764330))
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/issues/177), [2](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/issues/173), [3](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/issues/167), [4](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/issues/165), [5](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/issues/163))
* **Team-Based**:
  * Set up Git Repo and organization at the start of project.
  * Set up GitHub pages and added initial PPP for teammates.
