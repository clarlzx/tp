Hello! Are you a parent whose phone's contact book is filling up with the contacts of teachers? Do you have trouble
remembering who exactly that contact in your contact book is referring to? Do you have multiple children and want
a centralised place to keep track of all their activities? Then ParentPal could be the app for you!

ParentPal is a **desktop app for managing your children's contacts and their related appointments, 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a 
Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, ParentPal can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Understanding ParentPal

### Expired appointments
ParentPal helps you to manage your expired appointments by colouring them red, once expired. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Should the appointment not appear red despite it having expired, click on the appointment box to refresh it.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `exit 123`, it will be interpreted as `exit`.

### Editing data files

ParentPal data is saved as two JSON files in the `data` directory at `[JAR file location]/data` as
`addressbook.json` and `appointmentbook.json`. 
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ParentPal will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Changes to the data files may cause ParentPal to behave unexpectedly, edit the files at your own risk.
</div>

### Transferring your data to another device
#### Exporting your data
1. After running ParentPal at least once, locate the `data` folder on your device which can be found in the same directory as your JAR file. 
2. Transfer this `data` folder to your other device.
   
#### Importing your data
1. Install ParentPal on your new device and run it once, exit the program before proceeding.
2. Copy the `data` folder from your old device to the new device to the same directory as where you installed the JAR file.
3. Override the files on your new device when prompted.

Congratulations! You have successfully transferred your data to a new device.

## FAQ

**Q**: What's the difference between a ChildTag and a regular Tag? <br>
**A**: ChildTags are meant to represent your children, useful especially 
if you have multiple children. ChildTags will always appear at the front of the list of tags
for each contact and are displayed in a different color to differentiate them. Any command
that works with regular Tags such as `find` will also work with ChildTags.
