* ParentPal is a **desktop application designed for parents to manage their children-related contacts and appointments.**
* It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ParentPal can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
* It is named *ParentPal* because it aims to be a 'pal' to the busy parents who need help managing their kids' schedules and important contacts. 
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[ParentPal Product Website](https://ay2021s2-cs2103t-w13-3.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the **AddressBook-Level3 project** created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
